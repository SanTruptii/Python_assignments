Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing Techniques:
This code demonstrates a comprehensive approach to feature engineering and data preprocessing using two different datasets: the Titanic dataset and the Application Train dataset. It includes various techniques to handle missing values, detect and handle outliers, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, generate new features, and visualize data distributions and correlations.

1. Loading Datasets
    load_titanic and load_application_train functions load the Titanic and Application Train datasets respectively using pd.read_csv.
2. Inspecting Dataset Shapes
    The shapes of both datasets are printed to understand their sizes:
    Titanic dataset: (891, 12)
    Application Train dataset: (307511, 122)
3. Handling Missing Values
    handle_missing_values function fills missing values:
    Numerical columns: Filled with the median value.
    Categorical columns: Filled with the mode value.
4. Outlier Detection
    outlier_thresholds function calculates the interquartile range (IQR) to determine the upper and lower bounds for detecting outliers.
    check_outlier function checks if there are any outliers in a specified column based on these thresholds.
5. Column Categorization
    grab_col_names function categorizes columns into:
    cat_cols: Categorical columns.
    num_cols: Numerical columns.
    cat_but_car: Categorical columns with high cardinality (more than a specified threshold).
    num_but_cat: Numerical columns with low cardinality (less than a specified threshold).
6. Encoding Categorical Variables
    encode_categorical function encodes categorical variables:
    Binary categorical variables: Encoded using LabelEncoder.
    Non-binary categorical variables: Encoded using one-hot encoding.
7. Scaling Numerical Features
    scale_numerical function scales numerical features using StandardScaler.
8. Feature Generation
    generate_features function generates new features:
    Example: Creating a FamilySize feature in the Titanic dataset by combining SibSp and Parch columns.
9. Visualizing Data
    plot_num_feature_distribution function visualizes the distribution of numerical features using histograms with KDE plots.
    plot_cat_feature_distribution function visualizes the distribution of categorical features using count plots.
    plot_correlation_matrix function visualizes the correlation matrix of numerical features using a heatmap.

Summary:
This code provides a comprehensive and structured approach to feature engineering and data preprocessing. It includes essential techniques such as handling missing values, detecting and handling outliers, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, generating new features, and visualizing data. These steps are crucial for preparing data for machine learning models, ensuring that the data is clean, well-structured, and suitable for analysis. The use of visualizations helps in understanding the distributions and relationships within the data, which can inform further feature engineering and modeling decisions.
