Assignment 2:
Problem Statement: Simple calculator program in Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

Description:
Python program implements a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and modulus. The program defines separate functions for each operation, ensuring modularity and clarity. The calculator() function serves as the main interface, presenting a menu of operations to the user and handling user input.
The program continually prompts the user to select an operation and enter two numbers. It validates the input to ensure correct numeric values are provided, and it checks for division by zero in the division function. The user can exit the calculator by entering 'q'.
