To perform comprehensive feature engineering and preprocessing, as well as model evaluation and tuning on a dataset like the Titanic dataset, we can follow a multi-step approach. Here is an extended pipeline covering the requested tasks:

1. Data Preprocessing: Load data, handle missing values, and encode categorical features.
2. Feature Engineering: Create new features, select important features, and apply feature extraction.
3. Dimensionality Reduction: Apply PCA, LDA, and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction.
4. Model Training and Evaluation: Train the model, perform train-test split, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.
5. Metrics and Performance Evaluation: Calculate various evaluation metrics.
