Data Preprocessing for Predictive Modeling on Titanic Dataset:
A comprehensive example of data preprocessing on the Titanic dataset, which includes cleaning, handling missing values, transformation, normalization, encoding, and feature engineering.

Summary
This code performs the following preprocessing steps on the Titanic dataset:

1. Loading the Datasets: Load the train and test datasets using pandas.
2. Handling Missing Values: Fill missing values in numerical columns with the median and in categorical columns with the mode. Drop columns with a high percentage of missing values.
3. Encoding Categorical Variables: Encode binary categorical variables as numerical and apply one-hot encoding to non-binary categorical variables.
4. Feature Engineering: Create new features such as FamilySize, IsAlone, and extract Title from the passenger names. Simplify and encode these new features.
5. Scaling Numerical Features: Scale numerical features using StandardScaler.
6. Preparing Data for Modeling: Drop unnecessary columns, align the columns of the test set to match those of the training set, and separate features and target.

By following these steps, the data is cleaned, transformed, and ready for predictive modeling.
